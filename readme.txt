Python-based portfolio management

This demostrative project allows to analyze some economic data (timeseries of some ETFs in .csv value, containing values of stocks, bonds, estates through the time, from late 90s to 2017) and to apply a basic 
artificial intelligence algorithm in order to automatically build an ETF-based porfolio and backtest it through a period of time.

This project uses Python3, in particural Pandas library to manage the data, and implements a simple Genetic Algorithm to create a portfolio, using as "fitness function" the analysis of the Sharpe Ratio.
In order to improve the data representation the Matplotlib library is used to see the variation of the builded portfolio in the time.
